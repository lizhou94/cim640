    <h1>Calculates your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years.</h1>
    <p>My program focuses on calculating your dog's age based on the conversion rate of 1 human year to 7 dog years. First, I need the users to tell me age of their puppy.  I will use a a form text input for this. The user would have to click on a button to submit their answer. I will need a button. When the user clicks the button, I will activate my calculation function. In my function, I need to get the value of the form input. I will grab the number and multiply by 7. Then I will get the result. <br><br>
    input= age of puppy<br>
    output= dog's age in dog years<br>
    PuppyAgeCalc = PuppyAge * 7 <br>
    </p>
 
    <p><i>How old is your dog in dog years?</i></p>
   
    <br>
   
    <form>
        <label for="age">Age of Puppy:</label>
        <input type="number" name="age" id="age" min="0" max="100">
        <br><br>
        <button type="button" id="PuppyButton">Click for Answer</button>
        <br><br>
    </form>

            console.log(PuppyAge + "age");
           
            var PuppyAgeCalc = PuppyAge * 7;
            console.log(PuppyAgeCalc);
           
            var message = "Your dog is " + PuppyAgeCalc + " in dog years!";
            console.log(message);

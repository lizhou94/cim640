    <h1>How far have you travelled from Miami, Florida to New York</h1>
    <p>My program focuses on distance from Miami to New York. First, I need the users to tell me the number of miles they have driven. I will use a a form text input for this. The user would have to click on a button to submit their answer. I will need a button. When the user clicks the button, I will activate my calculation function. In my function, I need to get the value of the form input. I will grab the number divide it by 1634 the avergae miles and multiply by 100. This will give me a percentage. Then I will return a message telling them how far they have gone. 
    <br>
    input= current miles<br>
    output= percent of how far users have gone<br>
    milesCalculation = (currentMiles/averageMiles) * 100<br>
    average miles= 1634</p>
 
    <p><i>Enter your how many miles you have driven in order to figure out how far you have gone.</i></p>

    <h1>Lifetime Supply of Oreo cookies</h1>
   
    <p>My program focuses on calculating the amount of oreo cookies you will need to last you a lifetime. First, I need the users to tell me their age. I will use a a form text input for this. The user would have to click on a button to submit their answer. I will need a button. When the user clicks the button, I will activate my calculation function. In my function, I need to get the value of the form input. Then I will get the result. The variables are listed below <br><br>
    input= current age<br>
    output= the amount of cookies you will need to last you to 86 years old<br>
    maxAge=86<br>
    numPerDay= supply amount /365<br>
    totalNeeded= (numPerDay * 365) * (maxAge - supplyAmount) </p>
    
    
    <h3><i>How much oreo cookies will you need to last you a lifetime?</i></h3>
   
    <br>
   
    <p>Enter your current age below in order to calculate the amount of oreo cookies you will need to last you a lifetime.</p>
